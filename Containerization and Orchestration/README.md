If you use kind for this workshop create it with Ingress support.

[Kind config with ingress support](https://dustinspecker.com/posts/test-ingress-in-kind/)

```
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
  - role: control-plane
    kubeadmConfigPatches:
      - |
        kind: InitConfiguration
        nodeRegistration:
          kubeletExtraArgs:
            node-labels: "ingress-ready=true"        
    extraPortMappings:
      - containerPort: 80
        hostPort: 80
        protocol: TCP
      - containerPort: 443
        hostPort: 443

# The App!

![ToDo List](./assets/ToDoList.png "ToDo List")

[Front end](https://github.com/r-magalhaes/ws-frontend)

[Back end](https://github.com/r-magalhaes/ws-backend)

[Database](https://github.com/r-magalhaes/ws-database)


## Setup

- Navigate to a directory of your chosing to host the repositories

```git clone https://github.com/r-magalhaes/ws-frontend```

```git clone https://github.com/r-magalhaes/ws-backend```

```git clone https://github.com/r-magalhaes/ws-database```

# The Problem...

We've been managing the deployment of this application on-premise. So far this app is been used inside of your organisation which made it pretty simples to manage all around. You've dockarized the Front-end, Back-end and even the Database. Now your organisation decided to launch the app online for other people to use it.

Some things to take into consideration:
- You're aware you'll need to have control over increasing/decreasing load when the App goes live
- The App is still somewhat raw which means new updates will arrive and you want to have a system in place to have automated deployments
- You also want to take advantage of the dockerized images you already have

You've chosen to use Kubernetes as the container orchestration tool!

# Warmup

Let's focus on the foundation of it all...the Dockerfile.

## Objectives:
- Learn the basics of build a Dockerfile
- Employ some best-practices to it

## Notes:
- Clone/fork the following repo to start with [next-example](https://github.com/r-magalhaes/ws-next-postgres)

```git clone https://github.com/r-magalhaes/ws-next-postgres```

- Build the Dockerfile for this example project
- Let's employ some best practices to our already working Dockerfile

# The Challenge...

## To the clouds!!! ðŸš€

- Take the application (frontend, backend and database) and deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster.
- Create the necessary resources for all parts to communicate with each other.
- Make sure that all configuration and secrets are managed via Kubernetes resources and not injected on the images via docker build arguments.
